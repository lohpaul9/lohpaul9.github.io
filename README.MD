## Project Description ##
A website that facilitates communication between professor and students in large class sizes. 
Students provide real-time feedback in forms of “I am confused,” or questions. Students can also put time stamp during class so that they get a report on what they need to review at the end of class. Students will also participate in a post-lecture survey that will not only help them to identify what they learned and did not understand, but also inform the lecturers on how to better respond to the student’s needs. 

## Features ## 
* Live “I’m confused” button during lecture - and “I’m confused” bar showing for the lecturer
* Pre and post lecture feedback
* Interface to review data post-lecture for both students and lecturers

Some code modified from Spark Blue Django Twitter tutorial
